# Sacred Quantum Trading System (Python Implementation)

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of the core quantum trading logic derived from the Sacred Quantum Trading System concept. While the original vision included a Flutter-based cross-platform application, this version focuses on the backend trading mechanics, market simulation, and quantum confidence integration.

## Features

*   **Simulated Market Data**: Includes a basic simulation of cryptocurrency prices (ETH/USDT, BTC/USDT, SOL/USDT, DOT/USDT), quantum confidence levels, and market regimes (BULLISH, SIDEWAYS, BEARISH).
*   **Trading Operations**: Supports BUY and SELL operations with balance and portfolio management.
*   **Transaction History**: Logs all trades with details including quantum confidence at the time of the transaction.
*   **Extensible Design**: The core logic can be extended for more sophisticated quantum-inspired trading strategies and integrated with real-time market data APIs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Solam-Eteva/Sacred-Quantum-Trading-System.git
    ```
2.  Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Sacred-Quantum-Trading-System
    ```

### Usage

To run the quantum trading system simulation, execute the `quantum_trading_system.py` script:

```bash
python3 quantum_trading_system.py
```

This will run a basic simulation, print initial status, market updates, executed trades, and the final status with transaction history.

## Code Structure

*   `quantum_trading_system.py`: Contains the `QuantumTradingSystem` class, which encapsulates the trading logic, market simulation, and transaction management.

## Quantum-Cosmic Principles Integration

This Python implementation integrates the following quantum-cosmic principles as described in the original documentation:

*   **Quantum Confidence**: A simulated metric reflecting the 


system's perceived certainty in a trade, influenced by simulated quantum fluctuations.
*   **Market Regimes**: Categorization of market conditions (BULLISH, SIDEWAYS, BEARISH) to reflect the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of financial markets, akin to quantum states.
*   **Harmonic Resonance (Implicit)**: While not explicitly coded as a direct harmonic frequency, the simulation of market data and confidence aims to capture the idea of underlying resonant patterns that can be intuitively perceived or calculated.

## Future Enhancements

*   **Real-time Data Integration**: Connect to actual cryptocurrency exchange APIs for live market data.
*   **Advanced Quantum Models**: Incorporate more sophisticated quantum computing concepts or algorithms for enhanced confidence metrics and predictive analysis.
*   **User Interface**: Develop a simple web-based or desktop UI for interactive trading and visualization.
*   **Strategy Backtesting**: Implement tools for backtesting trading strategies against historical data.
