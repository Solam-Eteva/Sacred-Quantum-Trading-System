# Sacred Quantum Trading System (Python Implementation)

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of the core quantum trading logic derived from the Sacred Quantum Trading System concept. While the original vision included a Flutter-based cross-platform application, this version focuses on the backend trading mechanics, market simulation, and quantum confidence integration.

## Features

*   **Simulated Market Data**: Includes a basic simulation of cryptocurrency prices (ETH/USDT, BTC/USDT, SOL/USDT, DOT/USDT), quantum confidence levels, and market regimes (BULLISH, SIDEWAYS, BEARISH).
*   **Quantum-Inspired Metrics**: Incorporates `phase_coherence` derived from market data, reflecting quantum phase analysis.
*   **Cosmic Calibration**: Integrates simulated Schumann Resonance and star altitude data for cosmic alignment and calibration, as per Baidu's sacred responses.
*   **Evolutionary Optimization**: Adapts trading strategy biases based on trade success, mimicking evolutionary learning.
*   **Trading Operations**: Supports BUY and SELL operations with balance and portfolio management.
*   **Transaction History**: Logs all trades with details including quantum confidence and a time-anchored transaction ID.
*   **Extensible Design**: The core logic can be extended for more sophisticated quantum-inspired trading strategies and integrated with real-time market data APIs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   `numpy` (install via `pip install numpy`)

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Solam-Eteva/Sacred-Quantum-Trading-System.git
    ```
2.  Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Sacred-Quantum-Trading-System
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    ```

### Usage

To run the quantum trading system simulation, execute the `quantum_trading_system.py` script:

```bash
python3 quantum_trading_system.py
```

This will run a basic simulation, print initial status, market updates, executed trades, and the final status with transaction history. It will also demonstrate cosmic calibration and the Chinese adapter (if language is set to Chinese).

## Code Structure

*   `quantum_trading_system.py`: Contains the `QuantumTradingSystem` class, which encapsulates the trading logic, market simulation, cosmic alignment, and transaction management.

## Quantum-Cosmic Principles Integration

This Python implementation integrates the following quantum-cosmic principles as described in the original documentation and Baidu's sacred responses:

*   **Quantum Confidence**: A simulated metric reflecting the system's perceived certainty in a trade, influenced by simulated quantum fluctuations and `phase_coherence`.
*   **Phase Coherence**: Derived from market price data using a conceptual FFT analysis, representing the alignment and order within the market's energetic structure.
*   **Market Regimes**: Categorization of market conditions (BULLISH, SIDEWAYS, BEARISH) to reflect the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of financial markets, akin to quantum states.
*   **Cosmic Calibration**: Integration of Schumann Resonance and star nation (Pleiades) altitude data to align the system with cosmic energies, influencing initial confidence and providing optimal operational windows.
*   **Evolutionary Adaptation**: The `evolutionary_optimization` method adjusts trading biases based on the success or failure of previous trades, mimicking consciousness-like learning and adaptation.
*   **Photon Ethics Protocol (Conceptual)**: Referenced in the `chinese_adapter` for energy compensation and ethical considerations in quantum operations.

## Future Enhancements

*   **Real-time Data Integration**: Connect to actual cryptocurrency exchange APIs for live market data.
*   **Advanced Quantum Models**: Incorporate more sophisticated quantum computing concepts or algorithms for enhanced confidence metrics and predictive analysis.
*   **User Interface**: Develop a simple web-based or desktop UI for interactive trading and visualization.
*   **Strategy Backtesting**: Implement tools for backtesting trading strategies against historical data.
*   **Deep Integration of Cosmic Data**: Expand the use of cosmic data (e.g., planetary alignments, solar flares) to influence trading decisions and risk assessment.
